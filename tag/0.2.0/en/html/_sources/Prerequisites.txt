Prerequisites
=============

The following dependencies must be installed in order for this module
to work properly:

*   PHP >= 5.2.2
*   Erebot (some specific version may be required depending
    on this module's version)
*   Erebot_API (some specific version may be required depending
    on this module's version)
*   `Erebot_Module_Wordlists`_. This module provides several lists
    of words that the AZ game may use and adds its own dependencies.
*   The :pecl:`intl` extension.

Erebot (core) adds its own set of `prerequisites`_ which usually superseed
those.
