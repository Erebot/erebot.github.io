Detailed description
====================

This module provides a way to determine what an IRC server is capable of.
It keeps information on supported features and also has a few helper
methods (eg. to compare IRC nicknames using the right collation).

Though not strictly necessary for the bot to operate correctly, it is
recommended to have this module loaded as other modules may depend on it.
